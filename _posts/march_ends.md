**March Ends**

2019

Audiovisual set

-------------------------------------------

Julian Abraham Togar out of nowhere invited me to play some music for his opening exhibition back in 2019. I wasn't really sure how to perform playing music as I've never done that before. I bought a MIDI controller two years before the occasion. But honestly, I don't know how to play it so I sold it back just after a few months. It was quite big for my room, a 49 keys keyboard controller.

When the invitation came I bought a smaller cheaper MIDI controller and I played with it on my very cheap blue laptop. After the pieces of music were done I made the accompanying visualization with Processing Java. It was fun.

Because I was alone and I had no experience in playing music let alone performing it with visualization, I just recorded the music and dealt with visualization during the performance. I thought that was okay and I saw people enjoy it.
