The Dutch VOC brought coffee from Yemen (Mocha) to Batavia in the late 1600s. It was later developed in Java and Sumatra through the Forced Cultivation System (Cultuurstelsel).

Indonesia declared its independence on August 17, 1945.

The PRRI (West Sumatra) and Permesta (North Sulawesi) rebellions (1957--1958) arose from regional inequality, government dissatisfaction, and military unrest.

On May 18, 1958, pilot Allen Lawrence Pope was shot down by the Indonesian Air Force over Ambon and captured, revealing CIA involvement.

UUPA 1960, enacted by Soekarno, abolished colonial land law, established state control of land, limited ownership, allowed redistribution, and recognized adat law and land's social function.

When agrarian reform was implemented (especially in the early 1960s), many land conflicts occurred between peasants and landlords and between peasants and companies.

Peasant groups often carried out "aksi sepihak" (unilateral actions) by occupying land before legal processes were completed, and the TNI increasingly believed that the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) was using land reform to expand its power in the countryside.

The mass anti-communist killings took place in 1965 and resulted in the deaths of at least 500,000 to over one million deaths.
