The world is in a weird condition. There are so many things happening everywhere. Post-pandemic, climate change, forest fire, violence between nations, and robots versus humans paradigm. We see everything happening through the news. Reality scenes slide on our screen without a break.

Then suddenly we realize, we're living in the game without knowing who is the player. We are all at the never-ending war. Risking our blood and stomach to fight for the land and food. Thus, who are they who have the eyes and ears to hear us?
