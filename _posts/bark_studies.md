An extensive effort to document the biodiversity of the Lake Setu Patok conservation area in Cirebon, West Java, Indonesia. The works were carried out on various dates since 2024, with some plant species still lacking taxonomic identification and others believed to be endemic to the region. While the project was primarily organized as part of a social and ecological initiative to protect the area, the artistâ€™s experimentation with rendering this biodiversity through the bark as a painting has provided a unique and personal dimension to the experience.
