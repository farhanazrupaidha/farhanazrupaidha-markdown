An extensive effort to document the biodiversity founded in the Lake Setu Patok conservation area in Cirebon, West Java, Indonesia. These works were completed on various date since 2024, and until today, the taxonomic information about the plant is still unknown. Although the documentation project is mainly organized as part of the social and ecological attempt to save the area, the experimentation on rendering it through the bark as a painting has given the artist a unique experience.
