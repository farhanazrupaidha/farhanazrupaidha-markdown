**Learning to Become**

2015 - 2018

Single channel video - video series

-------------------------------------------

Rosalind Krauss describes video art as something that is different from other kinds of conventional art to argue that the art of video as a medium that has a tendency of psychological condition which is more subtle than the physical conditions that are generally found in sculpture and painting. Psychological conditions described by Rosalind Krauss have many manifested in the works after the era of the Fluxus movement. Subjectivity is a playful activity and is also a political move.

"Being in a World" as the core strength of existence is born through the elaboration of experience, awareness, trust, and empathy. Furthermore, work is an artifact of the activities of psychotherapy.

I imitate, reproduce, replicate, and respond to the paintings of many artists.

Because I think painting is an activity that is generally done in the studio of an artist.

I did this painting differently, I give a nock in line-by-line on a computer screen with a storied timing consistency. There are also efforts in order to blur the boundaries between the medium.

In the end, my work which is entitled Learning to Become (with the addition of the artists' name on the back of the title on each series of works), will be serialized in progress. I will continue to reproduce the works of the artists' paintings with the intention not to make a parody.

However, as a form of self-searching.
