**Aas Rolani - Sewulan Maning (Harmony Sliced by Farhanaz Rupaidha)**

2021

-------------------------------------------

This edited sound was made in 2021, around the time when I created Bayang. I used to listen to this song when I was on a bus which I took to take me home to Cikarang from Cirebon. It was beautiful though I don't understand the language.
