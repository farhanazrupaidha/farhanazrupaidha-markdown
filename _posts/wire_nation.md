-------------------------------------------

Wire Nation is the preceding code editing before the Radix Systema which was originally written by Daniel Shiffman as Flocking. The idea behind the editing is mainly the same as an investigation in regarding the case of originality that has gone through the development of technology.

This work is intentionally activated in the artist's website with interactions such as mouse dragging and mouse clicking without sound effects provided. The animated wire simulation that bursts out from the center of the screen somehow represents the phenomena of invisible wire in the global nation that is happening by the limitless progress of the internet and technological advancement.

As an audience or user, we can only wait for the end of the progression. Until then when we feel the anxiousness from the technological development that we as a human made earlier for the sake of civilization-changing we will eventually create the other one within the same system.

We will try to change it by clicking the generated code on the computer screen only to realize that we only change the color. We will drag the earlier code on the computer screen hurriedly just to see that we're making the same thing in a different direction. As it seems there is nothing really new but a looping thing in a different method.
