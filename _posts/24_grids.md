For 24 years the artist was born and lived in this city, she found that Cikarang had gone through a phase that began with the agrarian social system that evolved into modern society. Irregularities that occurred in the city of Cikarang have resulted in dirty looks and veils to the environment.

Disorders appear in Cikarang, not just as a result of environmental contamination/pollution which arises from the pollution of water, air, and soil as well as sound or noise, but also through the pressure arising from the economic, social, and employment.

This work is expected to be used as a picture of Cikarang through the pieces of recording that are presented from a subjective perspective (personal). Through the video channel amalgamation, the creator donated most of the basic stories and insights that stem from the experience of living for 24 years in Cikarang.
