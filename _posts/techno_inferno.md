**Techno Inferno**

5'24 min, single-channel video, 2019

* * * * *

Earth is fading with the extinction of nature. The wind blows the dead of the real beauty. Only the garbage lefts. The mountain of garbage from our excessive lust of foods, vehicles, hybrid conveniences and freedoms of communication. We hurt the land of nature by extracting fuel then give back to it as a waste.

We respect our gifts of beauty only through our electronic devices. We snap the scenery, record the sound and manipulate it into something that only depends on our selfish will. Beyond that matter, we eventually changed to be the mother of inferno to our own place of living.
